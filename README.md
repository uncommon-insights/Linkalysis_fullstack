# Note to Hackathon Judges
## Progress during hackathon period
At the time of the hackathon deadline, LinkAlysis had these results (verifiable by the Github commit timestamps):
### Code results
* Scripts to download SPL token data and run network analytics on it. [Link](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/network_analysis)
* Script to download NFT data, the downloaded data in BSON format, and outputs of the network metrics being run on this data. [Link](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/nft_data_download)
* Pitch deck, basic frontend and backend scripts that display some of the network metrics produced in the above repos for SPL tokens and NFTs. [Link](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/Linkalysis_fullstack)

### Analysis results
The analysis done is summarized in the pitch deck. [Download link](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/Linkalysis_fullstack/raw/main/20230314_pitch_LinkAlysis_final.pptx)

The main results are as follows:
* Motivation: Fake volume is generally bad for the ecosystem, and network analytics can help uncover such fake volume. Beyond that, network analytics has shown results on other blockchains, but these analytics rarely make it to B2C products.
* We show an example of how our analytics managed to uncover a trading ring consisting of 7 addresses, when existing products only perform pairwise linking. This has potential applications in detecting wash trades.
* We show that the top 10 addresses with the highest network metrics scores are different from the top 10 addresses by standard metrics (Total volume, total transaction count), suggesting that network analytics can be a good tool for discovery / understanding the ecosystem. 

### Further notes

We understand that the hackathon evaluation can only be done on progress made during the hackathon period. However, we are committed to building out a full product and we would be happy to receive feedback on the project in its entirety (including updates post hackathon) :)

## Progress post hackathon period
This will be updated over time as progress is made!
* Included README for the github repos
* Better UI

# Usage
Coming soon!
